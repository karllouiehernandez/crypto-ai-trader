# HANDOFF.md — Agent Resume Point

This file is the **single source of truth** for where development is right now.
Both Claude Code and GitHub Copilot Pro agents must read this file first and update it last.

## Resume Here — Sprint 32

**Sprint 31 complete.** Two strategy experiment plugins are implemented and auto-discovered. Both appear in the dashboard Backtest Lab strategy dropdown and are ready for evaluation. 526 tests passing.

### What was done in Sprint 31
- **`strategies/ema200_filtered_momentum.py`** (NEW) — EXP-001: momentum + breakout with 200 EMA trend filter. TRENDING: long only above EMA-200 with full EMA stack + ADX + pullback + volume; SQUEEZE: breakout only above EMA-200. Overrides `decide()` for regime-aware logic.
- **`strategies/mtf_confirmation_strategy.py`** (NEW) — EXP-002: mean-reversion requiring 1m + 5m + 15m RSI/BB oversold/overbought agreement. RANGING only. Resamples using `df.resample()` on DatetimeIndex; minimum 300 1m rows required.
- **`tests/test_sprint31_strategies.py`** (NEW) — 16 tests for both plugins: regime gates, EMA-200 gates, min-row guards, resampling guard, BUY/SELL signal triggers.
- **`knowledge/sprint_log.md`** — Sprint 30 closed, Sprint 31 opened.
- **`knowledge/experiment_log.md`** — EXP-001/002 marked IN PROGRESS with implementation method.
- **526 total passing** (+16 over Sprint 30)

### Sprint 32 Goal
Run the EXP-001 and EXP-002 backtests and record results.

**Steps:**
1. Open Backtest Lab in dashboard
2. Run `ema200_filtered_momentum` on BTCUSDT (last 30 days) — save the run
3. Run `mtf_confirmation` on BTCUSDT (last 30 days) — save the run
4. Compare both vs `rsi_mean_reversion_v1` baseline on the same window
5. Record metrics (Sharpe, Max DD, PF, N Trades) in `knowledge/experiment_log.md`
6. Update `knowledge/strategy_learnings.md` with conclusions
7. Decide: promote winner to active, continue iterating, or discard

**Or**: Check GitHub Projects board #1 for a different Sprint 32 priority.

### GitHub Sprint Tracking — Manual Fallback
- Attempted GitHub issue creation for Sprint 29 in `karllouiehernandez/crypto-ai-trader`
- Result: `403 Resource not accessible by integration`
- Manual issue title:
  `Sprint 29 — Dynamic Binance USDT Universe + Historical Data Coverage`
- Manual issue body:
  `Goal: remove the hardcoded 3-symbol restriction and support any Binance spot USDT pair across analysis, backtesting, paper trading, and live trading, with a Binance-first historical-data workflow and persisted runtime watchlist. Scope: discover Binance spot USDT pairs from metadata; replace static runtime symbol assumptions with a persisted runtime watchlist; allow dashboard analysis/backtest flows to choose any supported Binance USDT symbol; add backfill/audit/sync_recent commands for arbitrary symbols; fail backtests fast when the requested window has candle gaps; keep runtime activation explicit so chart/backtest selection does not auto-enable paper/live trading. Acceptance: any active Binance spot USDT symbol can be selected in dashboard and backtest flows; streamer and paper/live runtime use an editable persisted watchlist; historical backfill and gap audit work for non-default symbols; backtests stop with a clear error on incomplete windows; regression suite remains green.`
- Manual project-board card text:
  `Sprint 29 — Dynamic Binance USDT Universe + Historical Data Coverage: dynamic Binance USDT discovery, persisted runtime watchlist, arbitrary-symbol backfill/audit/sync, fail-fast gap detection, dashboard/runtime integration.`

## Resume Here — Sprint 26 (COMPLETED)

**Sprint 25 complete.** Dashboard now has a 4th "Market Focus" tab. Running a study fetches top-N Binance USDT pairs by 24h volume, backtests each with the active strategy, and ranks by composite score (Sharpe + profit_factor − drawdown). Results persist to DB. One-click prefill sends the top pick into Backtest Lab. 443 tests passing.

### What was done in Sprint 25
- `config.py` — added `MARKET_FOCUS_UNIVERSE_SIZE`, `MARKET_FOCUS_TOP_N`, `MARKET_FOCUS_BACKTEST_DAYS`, `_MARKET_FOCUS_EXCLUDE`
- `database/models.py` — added `WeeklyFocusStudy`, `WeeklyFocusCandidate` ORM models
- `market_focus/selector.py` (NEW) — deterministic ranking engine; no LLM required
- `backtester/service.py`, `dashboard/workbench.py`, `dashboard/streamlit_app.py` — integrated market focus into service layer and dashboard
- `tests/test_market_focus.py` (NEW) — 14 tests
- **443 total passing** (+14 over Sprint 24)

### Sprint 26 Goal
No queued roadmap item. Next agent should check GitHub Projects board `#1` or ask the user for the next priority.

## Agent Protocol

### When you START a session:
1. Read this file
2. Read `knowledge/agent_resume.md`
3. Read only the code files and KB files relevant to the active sprint
4. Read `knowledge/sprint_log.md` only if historical context is actually needed
5. Begin work on the "Resume Here" sprint

### When you END a session (or hit rate limit / cooldown):
1. Update the **Current State** table above (agent name, date, sprint completed/in-progress)
2. Update **Resume Here** with the exact task the next agent should pick up
3. Note any blockers or partial work in a `## In Progress` section below if mid-sprint
4. Update `knowledge/agent_resume.md` with the new compact resume state
5. Update `knowledge/sprint_log.md` with what was done this session

### Token-Saving Rule
- `knowledge/sprint_log.md` is the long-form archive, not the default first-read file
- Agent switching should prefer `HANDOFF.md` + `knowledge/agent_resume.md` + targeted source files
- Only pull historical sprint entries when a decision depends on older implementation details

### Handoff note format (add below if mid-sprint):
```markdown
## In Progress — [AGENT NAME] left off here

**Sprint:** Sprint N
**Last file edited:** path/to/file.py
**What was done:** (1-2 sentences)
**What's next:** (exact next step for the incoming agent)
**Partial work notes:** (anything the next agent needs to know)
```
