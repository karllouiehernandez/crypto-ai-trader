# HANDOFF.md — Agent Resume Point

This file is the **single source of truth** for where development is right now.
Both Claude Code and GitHub Copilot Pro agents must read this file first and update it last.

## Current State

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Last active agent** | Codex |
| **Last updated** | 2026-04-18 (Sprint 24 closed) |
| **Sprint completed** | Sprint 24 ✅ — Named scenario presets committed + ready to push |
| **Next sprint** | Sprint 25 — Weekly Market Focus Selector |
| **Blocking issues** | Add one of: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` to `.env` for LLM features |
| **Local worktree note** | `knowledge/experiment_log.md` may stay dirty while the background runtime process is running; do not edit or stage it unless you intentionally stop that process |
| **GitHub repo** | https://github.com/karllouiehernandez/crypto-ai-trader |
| **GitHub Projects board** | https://github.com/users/karllouiehernandez/projects/1 |
| **Reason for handoff** | Sprint 24 is complete; next agent should start Sprint 25 `Weekly Market Focus Selector` using the queued roadmap and GitHub tracking issue `#26` |

## Resume Here — Sprint 25: Weekly Market Focus Selector

**Sprint 24 complete.** The dashboard now supports reusable named presets on top of run-scoped scenarios. Presets are stored per strategy, can be applied back into the parameter form, and matching preset names now persist with saved runs. 429 tests passing.

### What was done in Sprint 24
- `database/models.py`, `backtester/service.py` — MODIFIED: added named preset persistence plus preset-aware saved runs
- `dashboard/workbench.py`, `dashboard/streamlit_app.py` — MODIFIED: `Backtest Lab` can now save/apply named presets and shows preset-aware scenario labels across comparison/run views
- `tests/test_backtester_service.py`, `tests/test_workbench_helpers.py` — MODIFIED: added coverage for preset persistence, preset matching, and preset-aware leaderboard labels
- **429 total passing** (+8 over Sprint 23)

### Sprint 25 Goal — Weekly Market Focus Selector
Recommend the best Binance spot `USDT` token for the current week using a low-token deterministic ranking flow that evaluates candidates with the active strategy and current params.

### Scope
- add a research-only symbol universe wider than runtime `SYMBOLS`
- discover a top-liquid Binance spot `USDT` shortlist dynamically
- rank that shortlist using recent backtest results for the active strategy and active params
- persist weekly study runs and ranked candidates
- surface the latest recommendation inside the dashboard workbench
- allow one-click prefill into `Backtest Lab`

Defaults:
- `config.SYMBOLS` remains the runtime watchlist
- no paper/live auto-switching
- no LLM requirement in the baseline weekly selector flow

### Step 1 — Verify baseline
```bash
pytest tests/ -q   # must show 429 passed
```

### Step 2 — Sprint close checklist
- [ ] All CRITICAL and HIGH review findings fixed
- [ ] `knowledge/agent_resume.md` updated for Sprint 25
- [ ] `knowledge/sprint_log.md` updated with Sprint 25 entry
- [ ] `HANDOFF.md` Current State table updated
- [ ] Committed and pushed to GitHub
- [ ] GitHub issue `#26` closed when Sprint 25 is complete

## Agent Protocol

### When you START a session:
1. Read this file
2. Read `knowledge/agent_resume.md`
3. Read only the code files and KB files relevant to the active sprint
4. Read `knowledge/sprint_log.md` only if historical context is actually needed
5. Begin work on the "Resume Here" sprint

### When you END a session (or hit rate limit / cooldown):
1. Update the **Current State** table above (agent name, date, sprint completed/in-progress)
2. Update **Resume Here** with the exact task the next agent should pick up
3. Note any blockers or partial work in a `## In Progress` section below if mid-sprint
4. Update `knowledge/agent_resume.md` with the new compact resume state
5. Update `knowledge/sprint_log.md` with what was done this session

### Token-Saving Rule
- `knowledge/sprint_log.md` is the long-form archive, not the default first-read file
- Agent switching should prefer `HANDOFF.md` + `knowledge/agent_resume.md` + targeted source files
- Only pull historical sprint entries when a decision depends on older implementation details

### Handoff note format (add below if mid-sprint):
```markdown
## In Progress — [AGENT NAME] left off here

**Sprint:** Sprint N
**Last file edited:** path/to/file.py
**What was done:** (1-2 sentences)
**What's next:** (exact next step for the incoming agent)
**Partial work notes:** (anything the next agent needs to know)
```
